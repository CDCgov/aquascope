            "description": "# CDCgov/aquascope\n\n## Introduction\n\n**CDCgov/aquascope** is a bioinformatics pipeline that ...\n\n<!-- TODO nf-core:\n   Complete this sentence with a 2-3 sentence summary of what types of data the pipeline ingests, a brief overview of the\n   major pipeline sections and the types of output it produces. You're giving an overview to someone new\n   to nf-core here, in 15-20 seconds. For an example, see https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq/blob/master/README.md#introduction\n-->\n\n<!-- TODO nf-core: Include a figure that guides the user through the major workflow steps. Many nf-core\n     workflows use the \"tube map\" design for that. See https://nf-co.re/docs/contributing/design_guidelines#examples for examples.   -->\n<!-- TODO nf-core: Fill in short bullet-pointed list of the default steps in the pipeline -->\n\n## Usage\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> If you are new to Nextflow and nf-core, please refer to [this page](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/installation) on how to set-up Nextflow. \n\n<!-- TODO nf-core: Describe the minimum required steps to execute the pipeline, e.g. how to prepare samplesheets.\n     Explain what rows and columns represent. For instance (please edit as appropriate):\n\nFirst, prepare a samplesheet with your input data that looks as follows:\n\n`samplesheet.csv`:\n\n```csv\nsample,fastq_1,fastq_2\nCONTROL_REP1,AEG588A1_S1_L002_R1_001.fastq.gz,AEG588A1_S1_L002_R2_001.fastq.gz\n```\n\nEach row represents a fastq file (single-end) or a pair of fastq files (paired end).\n\n-->\n\nNow, you can run the pipeline using:\n\n<!-- TODO nf-core: update the following command to include all required parameters for a minimal example -->\n\n```bash\nnextflow run CDCgov/aquascope \\\n   -profile <docker/singularity/.../institute> \\\n   --input samplesheet.csv \\\n   --outdir <OUTDIR>\n```\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> Please provide pipeline parameters via the CLI or Nextflow `-params-file` option. Custom config files including those provided by the `-c` Nextflow option can be used to provide any configuration _**except for parameters**_; see [docs](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/getting_started/configuration#custom-configuration-files).\n\n## Credits\n\nCDCgov/aquascope was originally written by S. Sevilla.\n\nWe thank the following people for their extensive assistance in the development of this pipeline:\n\n<!-- TODO nf-core: If applicable, make list of people who have also contributed -->\n\n## Contributions and Support\n\nIf you would like to contribute to this pipeline, please see the [contributing guidelines](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n## Citations\n\n<!-- TODO nf-core: Add citation for pipeline after first release. Uncomment lines below and update Zenodo doi and badge at the top of this file. -->\n<!-- If you use CDCgov/aquascope for your analysis, please cite it using the following doi: [10.5281/zenodo.XXXXXX](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.XXXXXX) -->\n\n<!-- TODO nf-core: Add bibliography of tools and data used in your pipeline -->\n\nAn extensive list of references for the tools used by the pipeline can be found in the [`CITATIONS.md`](CITATIONS.md) file.\n\nThis pipeline uses code and infrastructure developed and maintained by the [nf-core](https://nf-co.re) community, reused here under the [MIT license](https://github.com/nf-core/tools/blob/main/LICENSE).\n\n> **The nf-core framework for community-curated bioinformatics pipelines.**\n>\n> Philip Ewels, Alexander Peltzer, Sven Fillinger, Harshil Patel, Johannes Alneberg, Andreas Wilm, Maxime Ulysse Garcia, Paolo Di Tommaso & Sven Nahnsen.\n>\n> _Nat Biotechnol._ 2020 Feb 13. doi: [10.1038/s41587-020-0439-x](https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41587-020-0439-x).\n",

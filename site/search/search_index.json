Each step in the pipeline has a default set of requirements for number of CPUs, memory and time. For most of the steps in the pipeline, if the job exits with any of the error codes specified here it will automatically be resubmitted with higher requests (2 x original, then 3 x original). If it still fails after the third attempt then the pipeline execution is stopped.</p> <p>For example, if the nf-core/rnaseq pipeline is failing after multiple re-submissions of the <code>STAR_ALIGN</code> process due to an exit code of <code>137</code> this would indicate that there is an out of memory issue:</p> <pre><code>[62/149eb0] NOTE: Process `RNASEQ:ALIGN_STAR:STAR_ALIGN (WT_REP1)` terminated with an error exit status (137) -- Execution is retried (1)\nError executing process &gt; 'RNASEQ:ALIGN_STAR:STAR_ALIGN (WT_REP1)'\n\nCaused by:\n    Process `RNASEQ:ALIGN_STAR:STAR_ALIGN (WT_REP1)` terminated with an error exit status (137)\n\nCommand executed:\n    STAR \\\n        --genomeDir star \\\n        --readFilesIn WT_REP1_trimmed.fq.gz  \\\n        --runThreadN 2 \\\n        --outFileNamePrefix WT_REP1. \\\n        &lt;TRUNCATED&gt;\n\nCommand exit status:\n    137\n\nCommand output:\n    (empty)\n\nCommand error:\n    .command.sh: line 9:  30 Killed    STAR --genomeDir star --readFilesIn WT_REP1_trimmed.fq.gz --runThreadN 2 --outFileNamePrefix WT_REP1. &lt;TRUNCATED&gt;\nWork dir:\n    /home/pipelinetest/work/9d/172ca5881234073e8d76f2a19c88fb\n\nTip: you can replicate the issue by changing to the process work dir and entering the command `bash .command.run`\n</code></pre> <p>To bypass this error you would need to find exactly which resources are set by the <code>STAR_ALIGN</code> process. The quickest way is to search for <code>process STAR_ALIGN</code> in the nf-core/rnaseq Github repo. We have standardised the structure of Nextflow DSL2 pipelines such that all module files will be present in the <code>modules/</code> directory and so based on the search results the file we want is <code>modules/nf-core/software/star/align/main.nf</code>. If you click on the link to that file you will notice that there is a <code>label</code> directive at the top of the module that is set to <code>label process_high</code>. The Nextflow <code>label</code> directive allows us to organise workflow processes in separate groups which can be referenced in a configuration file to select and configure subset of processes having similar computing requirements. The default values for the <code>process_high</code> label are set in the pipeline's <code>base.config</code> which in this case is defined as 72GB. Providing you haven't set any other standard nf-core parameters to cap the maximum resources used by the pipeline then we can try and bypass the <code>STAR_ALIGN</code> process failure by creating a custom config file that sets at least 72GB of memory, in this case increased to 100GB. The custom config below can then be provided to the pipeline via the <code>-c</code> parameter as highlighted in previous sections.</p> <pre><code>process {\n    withName: STAR_ALIGN {\n        memory = 100.GB\n    }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>NB: We specify just the process name i.e. <code>STAR_ALIGN</code> in the config file and not the full task name string that is printed to screen in the error message or on the terminal whilst the pipeline is running i.e. <code>RNASEQ:ALIGN_STAR:STAR_ALIGN</code>. You may get a warning suggesting that the process selector isn't recognised but you can ignore that if the process name has been specified correctly. This is something that needs to be fixed upstream in core Nextflow.</p>"},{"location":"usage/#tool-specific-options","title":"Tool-specific options","text":"<p>For the ultimate flexibility, we have implemented and are using Nextflow DSL2 modules in a way where it is possible for both developers and users to change tool-specific command-line arguments (e.g. providing an additional command-line argument to the <code>STAR_ALIGN</code> process) as well as publishing options (e.g. saving files produced by the <code>STAR_ALIGN</code> process that aren't saved by default by the pipeline). In the majority of instances, as a user you won't have to change the default options set by the pipeline developer(s), however, there may be edge cases where creating a simple custom config file can improve the behaviour of the pipeline if for example it is failing due to a weird error that requires setting a tool-specific parameter to deal with smaller / larger genomes.</p> <p>The command-line arguments passed to STAR in the <code>STAR_ALIGN</code> module are a combination of:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Mandatory arguments or those that need to be evaluated within the scope of the module, as supplied in the <code>script</code> section of the module file.</p> </li> <li> <p>An <code>options.args</code> string of non-mandatory parameters that is set to be empty by default in the module but can be overwritten when including the module in the sub-workflow / workflow context via the <code>addParams</code> Nextflow option.</p> </li> </ul> <p>The nf-core/rnaseq pipeline has a sub-workflow (see terminology) specifically to align reads with STAR and to sort, index and generate some basic stats on the resulting BAM files using SAMtools. At the top of this file we import the <code>STAR_ALIGN</code> module via the Nextflow <code>include</code> keyword and by default the options passed to the module via the <code>addParams</code> option are set as an empty Groovy map here; this in turn means <code>options.args</code> will be set to empty by default in the module file too. This is an intentional design choice and allows us to implement well-written sub-workflows composed of a chain of tools that by default run with the bare minimum parameter set for any given tool in order to make it much easier to share across pipelines and to provide the flexibility for users and developers to customise any non-mandatory arguments.</p> <p>When including the sub-workflow above in the main pipeline workflow we use the same <code>include</code> statement, however, we now have the ability to overwrite options for each of the tools in the sub-workflow including the <code>align_options</code> variable that will be used specifically to overwrite the optional arguments passed to the <code>STAR_ALIGN</code> module. In this case, the options to be provided to <code>STAR_ALIGN</code> have been assigned sensible defaults by the developer(s) in the pipeline's <code>modules.config</code> and can be accessed and customised in the workflow context too before eventually passing them to the sub-workflow as a Groovy map called <code>star_align_options</code>. These options will then be propagated from <code>workflow -&gt; sub-workflow -&gt; module</code>.</p> <p>As mentioned at the beginning of this section it may also be necessary for users to overwrite the options passed to modules to be able to customise specific aspects of the way in which a particular tool is executed by the pipeline. Given that all of the default module options are stored in the pipeline's <code>modules.config</code> as a <code>params</code> variable it is also possible to overwrite any of these options via a custom config file.</p> <p>Say for example we want to append an additional, non-mandatory parameter (i.e. <code>--outFilterMismatchNmax 16</code>) to the arguments passed to the <code>STAR_ALIGN</code> module. Firstly, we need to copy across the default <code>args</code> specified in the <code>modules.config</code> and create a custom config file that is a composite of the default <code>args</code> as well as the additional options you would like to provide. This is very important because Nextflow will overwrite the default value of <code>args</code> that you provide via the custom config.</p> <p>As you will see in the example below, we have:</p> <ul> <li>appended <code>--outFilterMismatchNmax 16</code> to the default <code>args</code> used by the module.</li> <li>changed the default <code>publish_dir</code> value to where the files will eventually be published in the main results directory.</li> <li>appended <code>'bam':''</code> to the default value of <code>publish_files</code> so that the BAM files generated by the process will also be saved in the top-level results directory for the module. Note: <code>'out':'log'</code> means any file/directory ending in <code>out</code> will now be saved in a separate directory called <code>my_star_directory/log/</code>.</li> </ul> <pre><code>params {\n    modules {\n        'star_align' {\n            args          = \"--quantMode TranscriptomeSAM --twopassMode Basic --outSAMtype BAM Unsorted --readFilesCommand zcat --runRNGseed 0 --outFilterMultimapNmax 20 --alignSJDBoverhangMin 1 --outSAMattributes NH HI AS NM MD --quantTranscriptomeBan Singleend --outFilterMismatchNmax 16\"\n            publish_dir   = \"my_star_directory\"\n            publish_files = ['out':'log', 'tab':'log', 'bam':'']\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"usage/#updating-containers","title":"Updating containers","text":"<p>The Nextflow DSL2 implementation of this pipeline uses one container per process which makes it much easier to maintain and update software dependencies. If for some reason you need to use a different version of a particular tool with the pipeline then you just need to identify the <code>process</code> name and override the Nextflow <code>container</code> definition for that process using the <code>withName</code> declaration. For example, in the nf-core/viralrecon pipeline a tool called Pangolin has been used during the COVID-19 pandemic to assign lineages to SARS-CoV-2 genome sequenced samples. Given that the lineage assignments change quite frequently it doesn't make sense to re-release the nf-core/viralrecon everytime a new version of Pangolin has been released.

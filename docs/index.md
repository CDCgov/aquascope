This project is a successor to the [C-WAP pipeline](https://github.com/CFSAN-Biostatistics/C-WAP) and is intended to process SARS-CoV-2 wastewater samples to determine relative variant abundance.  

⚠️Warning⚠️ This pipeline has been validated for short reads. The results generated by this pipeline are not CLIA certified and should not be considered diagnostic.

## This project is a successor to the [C-WAP pipeline](https://github.com/CFSAN-Biostatistics/C-WAP) and is intended to process SARS-CoV-2 wastewater samples to determine relative variant abundance.  

## It has been validated for short reads. The results generated by this pipeline are not CLIA certified and should not be considered diagnostic.

## Introduction

<!-- TODO nf-core: Write a 1-2 sentence summary of what data the pipeline is for and what it does -->
**nf-core/aquascope** is a bioinformatics best-practice analysis pipeline for Pipeline is for early detection of SC2 variants of concern via shotgun metagenomic sequencing of wastewater.

The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io), a workflow tool to run tasks across multiple compute infrastructures in a very portable manner. It uses Docker/Singularity containers making installation trivial and results highly reproducible. The [Nextflow DSL2](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/dsl2.html) implementation of this pipeline uses one container per process which makes it much easier to maintain and update software dependencies. Where possible, these processes have been submitted to and installed from [nf-core/modules](https://github.com/nf-core/modules) in order to make them available to all nf-core pipelines, and to everyone within the Nextflow community!

<!-- TODO nf-core: Add full-sized test dataset and amend the paragraph below if applicable -->
On release, automated continuous integration tests run the pipeline on a full-sized dataset on the AWS cloud infrastructure. This ensures that the pipeline runs on AWS, has sensible resource allocation defaults set to run on real-world datasets, and permits the persistent storage of results to benchmark between pipeline releases and other analysis sources. The results obtained from the full-sized test can be viewed on the [nf-core website](https://nf-co.re/aquascope/results).

## Pipeline summary

<!-- TODO nf-core: Fill in short bullet-pointed list of the default steps in the pipeline -->

1. Read QC ([`FastQC`](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/))
2. Trimming reads  (['Fastp'] (https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp) )
3. Aligning short reads (['Minimap2] (https://github.com/lh3/minimap2))
4. Ivar trim aligned reads (['IVAR Trim'] (https://andersen-lab.github.io/ivar/html/manualpage.html))
5. Freyja Variant classification (['Freyja'] (https://github.com/andersen-lab/Freyja))
6. Present QC for raw reads ([`MultiQC`](http://multiqc.info/))

## Quick Start

1. Install [`Nextflow`](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/getstarted.html#installation) (`>=21.04.0`)

2. Install any of [`Docker`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/), [`Singularity`](https://www.sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/), [`Podman`](https://podman.io/), [`Shifter`](https://nersc.gitlab.io/development/shifter/how-to-use/) or [`Charliecloud`](https://hpc.github.io/charliecloud/) for full pipeline reproducibility _(please only use [`Conda`](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) as a last resort; see [docs](https://nf-co.re/usage/configuration#basic-configuration-profiles))_

3. The samplesheet.csv & test_highcoverage_samplesheet.csv is in assets folder, that contains path to samples. 

4. To create additional sample sheets, please use the fastq_dir_to_samplesheet.py - but make sure your sample files have _R1 & _R2. 
	> * Strandedness has to be determined to generate the samplesheet, if you don't know the strandedness, please check with Wet lab folks who generated the data!
	> * In case, you don't have information on strandedness, use "unstranded" (DNA Seq is bydefault Unstranded, While RNA sequencing is usually stranded)
	> * CLI, fastq_dir_to_samplesheet.py <full-path to Fastq file directory> -st <forward/reverse/unstranded> samplesheet.csv

5. test.config file already contains path to input, genome fasta, fai, primer (ARCTIC V4_1 primers are used currently), kraken2_human database (default, change as needed)

3. Download the pipeline and test it on a minimal dataset with a single command:

    ```console
    nextflow run main.nf -profile test,<docker/singularity/podman/shifter/charliecloud/conda/institute>
    ```

    > * Please check [nf-core/configs](https://github.com/nf-core/configs#documentation) to see if a custom config file to run nf-core pipelines already exists for your Institute. If so, you can simply use `-profile <institute>` in your command. This will enable either `docker` or `singularity` and set the appropriate execution settings for your local compute environment.
    > * If you are using `singularity` then the pipeline will auto-detect this and attempt to download the Singularity images directly as opposed to performing a conversion from Docker images. If you are persistently observing issues downloading Singularity images directly due to timeout or network issues then please use the `--singularity_pull_docker_container` parameter to pull and convert the Docker image instead. Alternatively, it is highly recommended to use the [`nf-core download`](https://nf-co.re/tools/#downloading-pipelines-for-offline-use) command to pre-download all of the required containers before running the pipeline and to set the [`NXF_SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR` or `singularity.cacheDir`](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/singularity.html?#singularity-docker-hub) Nextflow options to be able to store and re-use the images from a central location for future pipeline runs.
    > * If you are using `conda`, it is highly recommended to use the [`NXF_CONDA_CACHEDIR` or `conda.cacheDir`](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/conda.html) settings to store the environments in a central location for future pipeline runs.

4. Start running your own analysis!

    <!-- TODO nf-core: Update the example "typical command" below used to run the pipeline -->

    ```console
    nextflow run main.nf -profile <docker/singularity/podman/shifter/charliecloud/conda/institute> --input samplesheet.csv
    ```
